;; The catalogue package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; We have to add this to the load-path:
(let ((package-dir (concat "/usr/share/"
                           (symbol-name flavor)
                           "/site-lisp/catalogue")))
;; If package-dir does not exist, the catalogue package must have
;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
  (when (file-directory-p package-dir)
    (load (expand-file-name "catalogue" package-dir) t)))
